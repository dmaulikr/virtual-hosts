Virtual Hosts 1.0
=================

Hello. Thank you for downloading the Virtual Hosts plug-in for Coda 2.

This plug-in enables you to manage the adding/removing/editing of Apache Virtual Host entries.

Simply click the + button to add a Virtual Host. Type the relevant information and click the Save Changes button to save to the hosts and vhost files respectively. Web Sharing will automatically restart every time you click the Save Changes button.

For advanced options, click the action menu next to the + button to backup you vhost file, flush DNS cache and open Apache access/error, or the hosts/vhost files in Coda 2.

In addition, you can enable and disable Apple Web Sharing by click the "Web Sharing is on" or "Web Sharing is off" button at the bottom.

For actions such as starting/stopping Web Sharing and saving changes to your virtual hosts, you will be prompted for a password. This is the standard OS X Security dialog box and is required to make changes to secure files and processes.

Please note, in OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion), Apple removed Web Sharing from the System Preferences. If you are on a new machine or a fresh install, you may have to do more setup to get Apache fully functioning before this plug-in will work.

Please see this article for very detailed information on getting Web Sharing restored:

Once you follow these steps, Web Sharing should function normally.

You can use this plug-in via the Plug-ins menu item in Coda 2 or by pressing Control-Option-Command-V on your keyboard.

NOTE: Each time you open the Virtual Hosts window you will be prompted to backup your Virtual Hosts if you have not done so already. It is best to backup the first time you are asked, then you will not receive this prompt again.
